    <!-- Welcome Section -->
    <section class="mb-12">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Welcome to the GATE Computer Science Course by Delcin</h2>
      <p class="text-lg">
        I was a Maths graduate (Msc., Mathematics and Computing from IIT Guwahati). I wanted to learn more about computer science and
        I naturally mastered the theory topics like TOC, DSA and Compilers which are often considered difficult by the CS graduates.
        I was able to secure AIR 360 with GATE score 758 (59.68 out of 100).
        Of course I scored marks from other topics like Discrete Maths, Computer architecture, OS, DBMS and networks too.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">My teaching style</h2>
      <p class="text-lg">
        I consider teaching as an active exercise. Every student poses a new problem.
        What do I mean by that? Every one of us have an unique way understanding things and an unique set of learned knowledge.
        Which means I need to focus on every one of my student to help them understand the concept that I'm trying to teach.
        So because of this the number of students in my online class will be restricted to 6.
      </p>
      <p>
        This helps you to ask questions when needed without hesitation and interruption of the entire class
        because there will be atmost 6 of you!
        This also gives me a chance to evaluate the progress that you are making during the class itself and adjust the pace accordingly.
      </p>
    <h3 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Uniqueness about this approach</h2>
    <p>
        In a typical classroom online or offline students are overcrowded. Despite the best efforts of the teacher
        individual attention is not possible. This forces the teacher to go by the script except for one or two students
        who are exceptional in that particular day!
    </p>
    <h3 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Why 6 per class?</h2>
    <p>
      It is better than 50 per class but more affordable than 1 on 1 coaching.
      It also provides an environment where students can interact among themselves,
      help one another with reduced stress in some cases.
      Take for example, like I said before every one of us has our own perspective/way of looking at this world.
      Your fellow student might ask a question or provide a solution that you never even thought about.
      Group classes has it's advantage too!
    </p>

    <!-- Theory Masterclass-->
    <section id="theory" class="mb-12">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 text-blue-500">Theory Masterclass GATE 2026</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        In this course we focus on the following topics,
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
        <li>Discrete Mathematics</li>
        <li>Data structures and algorithmms</li>
        <li>Theory of Computation</li>
        <li>Compilers</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 text-blue-500">Why you should take this course?</h2>
      <p>
        Once you master these topics it is very hard to get the answer wrong. You don't have to rely
        on your memory too much because it comes with very few definitions and with practice you'll memorise it by heart.
        In the exam hall even under time pressure you can be absolutely sure that your answers are correct.
      </p>
      <p>
        It will also prepare you for Masters/PHD interviews in IITs because it is expected that you should have understood these topics thoroughly.
        This will also help you immensly in job interviews.
        If you can implement a toy compiler in your favourite programming language that would attract the interest of superstar devs!
